# New Relic Telemetry SDK for NodeJS

The New Relic NodeJS Telemetry SDK allows you to send telemetry data to New Relic from your application without a [traditional language agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic).

The Telemetry SDK serves as a foundation for getting open standards based telemetry data like [Open Census](https://opencensus.io/), [Open Tracing](https://opentracing.io/), and [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) into New Relic.  If you're building exporters or tracers based on these standards, you've come to the right place.

## Prerequisites

- A New Relic Insights API Key
- A NodeJS 10+ Runtime

## Getting Started

To get started with the Telemetry SDK, you'll need a New Relic Insert API key. If you need help finding or generating this (or any) API key, [our docs have you covered](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys).

Once you have this key in place, you can install the `@newrelic/telemetry-sdk` package via `npm` (or your preferred package manager)

    $ npm install @newrelic/telemetry-sdk

Once installed, you can get started with a simple program that will create a metric, record one occurrence of that metric, and then send that metric to New Relic in a batch.

```javascript
    const {MetricBatch,CountMetric,MetricClient}
      = require('@newrelic/telemetry-sdk').telemetry.metrics

    // create our client using the metrics API key
    const client = new MetricClient({
      apiKey: 'abc...123'       // your metrics API key
                                // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api#access-requirements
    })

    // create the metric object
    const metric = new CountMetric('our-metric')

    // record a single occurance of this metric
    metric.record()


    // create a batch and add our metric
    const batch = new MetricBatch(
      {},              // attributes (or "tags") to send with
                       // every metric in this batch (you can
                       // also set attributes/tags on individual
                       // metrics)
      Date.now(),      // timestamp
      1000             // interval -- how offten we're sending this data in milliseconds
    )
    batch.addMetric(metric)

    client.send(batch, function(err, res, body) {
      console.log(res.statusCode)
    })
```

## Key Concepts

The Telemetry SDK provides you, the end-user-programmer, with a _Client_ that sends _Spans_ or _Metrics_ to New Relic.  Individual Metrics and Spans are collected together into batches (via a _MetricBatch_ or _SpanBatch_ object), and clients send these batches.

In addition to the examples below, the integration tests and server-integration tests contain a number of examples that show how clients, metrics, spans, and batches are all used.

## Span Overview and Examples

To get stared with spans, you'll use code similar to the following.

```javascript
    const sdk = require('@newrelic/telemetry-sdk')
    const {
      SpanClient,
      SpanClientOptions,
      SpanBatch,
      Span
    } = require('@newrelic/telemetry-sdk').telemetry.spans
    const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4')

    // create our client using the metrics API key
    const client = new SpanClient({
      apiKey: 'abc...123'       // your trace API key
                                // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/report-new-relic-format-traces-trace-api#new-relic-quick-start
    })

    const batch = new SpanBatch;

    const traceId = Date.now().toString()
    const parentId = uuidv4();

    // create a parentSpan object
    const parentSpan = new Span(
        parentId,                   // a unique identifier for a span
        traceId,                    // a unique identifier for this trace,
        Date.now(),                 // a timestamp
        'firstSpan',                // a name for this span
        null,                       // this span's parent, null since this is the top
                                    // level span
        'node-sdk-example-entity',  // a name for ths service being traced
        10                          // span's duration
    );

    // then create some child spans, linking them to the
    // parent via their parent ID
    const child1 = new Span(
        uuidv4(),
        traceId,
        Date.now(),
        'secondSpan',
        parentId,                  // this span's parent
        'node-sdk-example-entity',
        5
    );

    const child2 = new Span(
        uuidv4(),
        traceId,
        Date.now(),
        'thirdSpan',
        parentId,                  // this span's parent
        'node-sdk-example-entity',
        22
    );

    // add the spans to the batch
    batch.addSpan(parentSpan)
    batch.addSpan(child1)
    batch.addSpan(child2)

    // send the batch
    client.send(batch, function(err, res, body) {
      console.log(res.statusCode)
    })
```

The Telemetry SDK provides you with a client and batch objects for sending multiple spans to New Relic in a single HTTPS request.  Where and how you use these objects in your tracers/exporters is up to you.

If you want to use the Telemetry SDK to send spans to an API endpoint other than the default, you can instantiate a `SpanClient` with a specific `host` and `port`.  This isn't something most users will *need* to do, but if you've received an alternative API endpoint from New Relic, or need to send data to a different URL, the `SpanClient` is able to accommodate you.

```javascript
const client = new SpanClient({
      apiKey: 'abc...123',
      host: 'example.com',
      port: 8443
    })
```

## Metrics Overview and Examples

The Telemetry SDK allows you to send three different Metric types to New Relic

- GaugeMetric
- CountMetric
- SummaryMetric

| Metric Type | Interval | Description                                        | Example                                       |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Gauge       | No       | A single value at a single point in time.          | Room Temperature.                             |
| Count       | Yes      | Track the total number of occurrences of an event. | Number of errors that have occurred.          |
| Summary     | Yes      | Track count, sum, min, and max values over time.   | The summarized duration of 100 HTTP requests. |

You can learn more about each individual metric type [via the New Relic Docs Site](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/report-metrics-metric-api#supported-metric-types).  Each individual metric type has a corresponding type in the Telemetry SDK.

```javascript
    const {CountMetric, GaugeMetric, SummaryMetric} =
      require('@newrelic/telemetry-sdk').telemetry.metrics;

    // https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-node/blob/c678ebfbea6e09f35c30734615030dbc5f46dc12/src/telemetry/metrics/count.ts#L4
    const counting = new CountMetric(...)

    // https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-node/blob/c678ebfbea6e09f35c30734615030dbc5f46dc12/src/telemetry/metrics/gauge.ts#L4
    const aGuage = new GuageMetric(...)

    // https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-node/blob/c678ebfbea6e09f35c30734615030dbc5f46dc12/src/telemetry/metrics/summary.ts#L11
    const summary = new SummaryMetric(...)
```
